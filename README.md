Odin Project: Recipes

Welcome to the Odin Recipes project! This is one of the foundational projects from The Odin Project, designed to help beginners practice basic HTML skills by building a simple website.
🔧 Project Description

This project is a basic recipe website built using only HTML. It includes:

    A main homepage that links to individual recipe pages

    Multiple recipe pages, each detailing the ingredients and steps needed to prepare a dish

    Basic use of headings, paragraphs, lists, links, and images

The goal of the project is to get comfortable writing structured HTML and working with file linking in a real project format.
